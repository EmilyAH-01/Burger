INSTALLATION:
Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL are required for this program. To set up the database, first run schema.sql in MySQL, then seeds.sql to populate the table. In the command line, enter "npm install".

USAGE:
In command line, enter: node server.js

DESCRIPTION: 
This full-stack application accepts user input (a burger name), displays the input on the page, and stores the input in the MySQL database. Each burger entered can then be "eaten" by pressing the "Eat the Burger!" button next to each burger name. This sets the corresponding value of the "devoured" column in the database from false to true, then moves the burger name to the "Burgers eaten" side of the page.
